CatchOfTheDay Developer Exam
=======

To help us understand you as a developer, we've designed this simple exam. It's an incomplete single-page TODO list application. We've placed `// TODO`
comments in the code where we believe it is incomplete.

To keep things simple, this was built on top of Symfony 3.1 Standard Edition. At a minimum, these are the steps required to run the application on your
machine.
- Download Composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- `composer install`
- `bin/console assets:install`
- `bin/console server:start`
